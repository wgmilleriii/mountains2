For a web project that uses New Mexico terrain, elevation, and mountain data, you can tap into several open datasets that offer geographic and topographic data. Here are a few sources where you can find this type of data:

USGS (United States Geological Survey) - The USGS provides a wide range of geographic data, including elevation and terrain. Their 3DEP (3D Elevation Program) dataset includes detailed elevation models.

Website: USGS National Map

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - NOAA offers various datasets related to terrain, including elevation data and topographic maps.

Website: NOAA Data

USDA Geospatial Data Gateway - This platform includes various datasets related to terrain, land use, and more, focusing on U.S. geography.

OpenTopography - A great resource for high-resolution topographic data, including LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data.

Website: OpenTopography

New Mexico Resource Geographic Information System (RGIS) - This is a state-specific resource for New Mexico, where you can access detailed datasets for terrain, elevation, and other geographic features.

Website: New Mexico RGIS

These sources should give you everything you need to build a robust web project with New Mexico terrain data. Would you like help with how to integrate this data into your project?
